# Graffiti Incident Tracing System (GITS)

The Graffiti Incident Tracing System (GITS) is a integrated report system to aid
the Central City police department in graffiti identification, classification,
and tracking. *GITS* is a work in progress with the following major capabilities
for this system:

* An Internet portal that allows Central City Public Works personnel to document
  graffiti and send the incident data to the appropriate investigating law
  enforcement official.
* User interface that will allow an investigating law enforcement official to
  view, edit, and update the incident data along with any photo(s) of the damage
  and identity of graffiti suspects(s).
* Analysis capabilities that will allow law enforcement personnel to identify
  "hot spots".
* Reporting capabilities that will allow authorized staff to request, view
  and/or print reports based on information in the database.
