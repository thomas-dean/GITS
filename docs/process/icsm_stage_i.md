# Stage I: Incremental Definition

## Exploration Phase

The goal of this phase is to spend time exploring alternative solutions to
identify candidate(s) that will potentially provide a sufficient return on the
investment made to acquire and use the solution over time. To conduct this
exploration, it is important to take time to:

* Understand the capability (or set of capabilities) and its importance to the
  target stakeholders and users
* Identify various ways for providing the capability
* Evaluate the feasibility of providing the capability within acceptable cost
  and schedule limits, enterprise-fit constraints, and current technology
  maturity

It is also at this point that innovation and creativity can be of most value 
in identifying candidate solutions to an identified need. The tradespace is 
open to consider a realm of possibilities, whether it be a new process, 
repurposing an existing system or process, or a new system or set of systems.

### Typical Exploration Phase Activities Guidance Questions

* What is the real need?
* Who wants it and why?
* Who is/are the key proponent(s)?
* How strong is the business case? What is the expected market share?
* Who are the other stakeholders/competitors that can impact success?
* What will its impact be on current enterprise/market capabilities or systems 
  (good or bad)?
* Are there nontechnology options for addressing the need?
* Can existing systems be modified to address the new need?
* What are the supporting technologies and opportunities?
* Can we find the right personnel, partners, suppliers, and subcontractors?
* What are the key technologies we will depend on?
* What are the obstacles to success and how can they be avoided?
* What are other nontechnology aspects that will impact cost, schedule, and 
  overall success (e.g., regulatory, legal, political, cultural)?

By focusing on these aspects and questions, the potential solutions spaces are 
explored. For those needs that cannot be met by nontechnology solutions or 
changes to existing systems, a business case is developed and a risk 
assessment conducted for the proposed new system or set of systems. If the 
proposed new system will require a new innovation or maturing a relatively new 
technology, more detailed feasibility evidence may be required to support the 
commitment review to proceed further. If the proposed system will require a 
major financial investment, the stakeholders and decision makers may want to 
pursue multiple solutions and fund a competitive prototyping activity. The 
level of



## Valuation Phase

The goals and objectives of the Valuation phase are twofold:

* Elaborate the analyses of alternative solutions, to include sufficient 
  feasibility evidence and a detailed business case for each.
* Identify key risks associated with each alternative and ensure that each 
  risk is resolved or covered by a risk mitigation plan.

During this phase, the solution tradespace is rigorously investigated, looking 
for “sweet spots” to balance user needs with cost-effective solutions. For “
extreme” requirements or requirements that push the limits of current 
technology or cost/ schedule constraints, a range of options is evaluated to 
determine a candidate set of solutions that are “good enough” and provide 
flexibility to incorporate the “extreme requirements” at some point in the 
future.

### Typical Valuation Phase Activities Guidance Questions

* What are the “extreme” requirements with respect to existing capabilities 
  and generally available solutions?
* Will less extreme performance/capability suffice? If so, what are the 
  various levels of acceptability?
* If COTS products are in the candidate solution spaces:
  * How much tailoring (e.g., adaptation, customization, initialization) will 
   be required?
  * What will this tailoring effort entail?
  * Will this tailoring need to be reimplemented each time the product is 
   upgraded?
  * How flexible is the product?
  * How scalable is the product?
  * How interoperable is it with other planned COTS products/systems?
  * How stable is the vendor?
  * How many customers are using the current version of the COTS product?
  * How satisfied are these customers?
* If new technologies are being considered in the solution space:
  * How mature are they?
  * Have they been used in similar applications?
  * Do they scale to the desired level?
  * If not sufficiently mature, what is the status of efforts to get the 
   technology to the desired maturity level?
* Do any of the alternatives under consideration require some level of 
  innovation? If so:
  * Have innovation efforts been funded?
  * What is the progress to date?
* Are there any new stakeholders? If so, what are their win conditions?
* Is anyone else trying to develop a similar capability? If so, might a joint 
  effort work?
* Are any public– private partnerships available to support technology/product 
  development?
* What are the expected costs (development and total cost of ownership, 
  including any recurring costs associated with COTS products such as annual 
  license fees) for the top alternatives?
* What is the expected return on investment?

The answers to the applicable questions will drive feasibility assessments, 
prototype development, product evaluations, and benchmarking activities.

## Foundations

The objective of the Foundations phase is to ensure that the proposed approach 
for a system or capability has the solid technical and management foundations 
needed to ensure successful development. These foundations include a sound 
system architecture and associated feasibility evidence, a set of requirements 
at the system level and for each architecture component, development plans, 
and cost and schedule estimates sufficient to convince key decision makers to 
proceed with the Development phase. It is the “goodness” of the system 
foundations that ensures the “goodness” of the system (or system capability). 
It has been shown time and time again that insufficiently understood, 
inflexible, weak, and poor foundations are the cause of many development 
problems or early system retirements.

In the Foundations phase, management and technical foundations are developed 
for the selected option/ alternative. At this point in the life cycle, there 
may still be more than one option or alternative under development. However, 
by the end of this phase, there is typically only one alternative going 
forward into the Development phase.

Technical foundations include a fully developed system architecture, 
prototypes of critical foundational aspects or components, and evidence of 
technology maturity for those newer technologies that are key to the selected 
option/ alternative.

### Typical Valuation Phase Activities Guidance Questions

* Have needs or requirements changed?
* What is the context for the new need— for example, what are interfacing 
  systems/ components, data sources, and output destinations?
* What is the status of desired innovations or new technologies? Have they 
  been sufficiently matured, or should alternatives be considered?
* What are the expected performance parameters for the capability (timing/ 
  speed, throughput, number of concurrent users, precision/ accuracy), and have 
  they been adequately demonstrated or evaluated?
* Are there any critical operating temperature, power, or space requirements 
  or other constraints, and have these tolerances and thresholds been 
  adequately evaluated?
* Is the new capability being provided as a system of systems capability?
* Does the new capability require the development of any new systems or 
  components? If so, what are the candidate approaches and foundations for the 
  new systems and components? Are the systems’ and components’ interfaces 
  compatible with the interfacing systems and components? If not, how will 
  these “connections” be handled? Will “connectors” impact the overall system 
  performance parameters or constraints?
* For software-intensive devices and platforms:
  * How will software be used to control the interoperation of the components?
  * How will software contribute to the required capabilities/ 
   features?
  * What impact will software and software processors have on overall weight, 
   fuel, power, or heat dissipation requirements?
* What are the minimum essential components?
* What is the desired versus expected performance of the system or capability?
* What are the tolerance levels for key performance parameters?
* Will less extreme performance/capability suffice? If so, what are the various 
  levels of acceptability?
* If COTS products are in the candidate solution space, reevaluate the COTS 
  Valuation questions before making a final commitment:
  * How much tailoring (e.g., adaptation, customization, initialization) will 
   be required?
  * What will this tailoring effort entail?
  * Will this tailoring need to be reimplemented each time the product is 
   upgraded?
  * How flexible is the product?
  * How scalable is the product?
  * How interoperable is it with other planned COTS products and systems?
  * How stable is the vendor?
  * How many customers are using the current version of the COTS product?
  * How satisfied are these customers?
* How will systems and components interoperate with each other to provide the 
  desired capabilities?
* How will the system users interact with the system? How many users will be 
  required to effectively or safely operate the system?
* How many users can concurrently use the system without significant 
  degradation of capabilities? How does this compare to the expected number of 
  concurrent users?
* How has the expected performance been demonstrated or estimated?
* How has compliance with constraints and tolerances been demonstrated?
* Which system features are “must haves,” which are “needed to some extent, but 
  not at full performance levels initially,” and which are “nice to haves”?
* Are there any new stakeholders? If so, what are their win conditions?

By addressing these questions, the foundations for the new capability or 
system are designed, evaluated, and evolved until the solution architecture 
has been shown to be sufficiently robust, flexible, and cost-effective for 
subsequent development and longer-term enhancement. The Foundations phase is 
not just about process and tradespace considerations, but actually includes 
the development of the foundations necessary for successful development in 
Stage II. The final question to ask at the end of the Foundations phase is, 
“Have the Foundations been sufficiently defined to allow multiple teams to 
proceed with development in parallel?”
